    <p>You know how "synergy" became a joke-y buzzword because it was all <i>anyone</i> would ever talk about? Well it's unfortunate, because it's kind of a cool thing. There's a particular kind of energy that is created when two people are feeding off one another's ideas and momentum. Pair programming aims to take all the icky associations people have with programming — solitary, frustrating, boring – and turn them on their head.</p>
    <p>At its best, pair programming can be two people finishing each other's sentences, catching errors, and making the work go twice as fast as it would alone. At its worst, it can be one of the most frustrating experiences of coding. I've had pairings where I wanted to ask my pair to be my roommate afterwards because we were just so clearly on the same wavelength. I've had other pairings where I though my pair should have been held back a cohort based on their utter lack of understanding. Both of these situations were valuable because I stretched myself and learned to work with different types of people. It's helpful to have another person to fill in gaps in your understanding and to reinforce your own knowledge by teaching someone else.</p>
    <p>Coding is fundamentally about building something. In a work setting, that's likely going to involve a team, sometimes large, all playing different roles in building that thing. It's important to have experience working with different types of people and to have an understanding of your own strengths and weaknesses in working with others. Pairing can be a rewarding experience in its own right, but it will always teach you something about working with others.</p>
