      It's every programmer's nightmare: you break the site. You've been flexing your muscles, using new CSS tricks and doing all sorts of database-y things you read on StackOverflow (bear with me, I don't know what I'm talking about yet), and at the moment you proudly migrate your code to live, it all crashes. What's a n00b to do? Enter git. Git provides a system of version control to take snapshots of your work at key moments that you specify. When you tell git to take a snapshot of your code, you are giving yourself fail-safe. In the event that something you do introduces a bug, you can always revert back to the last snapshot you took when everything was hunky-dory.

      Git works off of a tree-like system to allow you to make copies of the "perfect" code and work on those branches independently. When you're all done, you can push that branch with all the different pieces of code you worked on back into the master branch (which is really like the singular trunk everything relies on) and introduce your work to the world. Beautiful, innit?

      Just when you think it couldn't get any better, we learn about GitHub. GitHub integrates with git to share all of your work with other developers so that they can learn from your code, review it, and work on projects alongside you. GitHub allows everyone to make their own copies of the master code and edit it to their heart's content, all the while operating entirely independently of other developers so nobody steps on someone else's toes. It is essential for teams collaborating on projects, and a really neat way to peak into the brains of some skilled people who've decided to share their code for you to learn from.

      All of these tools are just the beginning, but <i>crucial</i>, foundation. In the coming weeks, I look forward to using these great tools for making things and telling you all about it!
