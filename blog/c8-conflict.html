    <p>Senior year of college, I lived in a house with 7 of my friends. Well, they were my friends going into the year. By the end, there had been so much conflict that barely anybody was speaking to one another. It turns out that living with that many people in close quarters is trying, to say the least. Things like a bag of frozen meatballs forgotten on the counter of Thanksgiving break, loud, ahem, bedroom noises at all hours of the night, and someone's designated vegetarian-only tableware used for chicken korma all resulted in passive-aggressive notes taped to the refrigerator or all-out screaming matches.</p>
    <p>The ongoing one was with a girl who lived on my floor over the thermostat temperature. Our landlord paid for the house's heat, so I was looking forward to finally not being cold all winter. She, however, preferred to be cool. I would get home and turn the thermostat up, then she would turn it down. This warring continued all year, with occasional outbursts of frustration when the other changed our selection. My room was draftier than hers, so what was comfortable for her was freezing for me. I argued that she could crack her window to cool down, but I couldn't make it warmer. She countered that I could buy a space heater, but that seemed like such an unnecessary cost when our heating was free. Plus, it wouldn't heat up the common area on our floor or the bathroom.</p>
    <p>Over time, I realized that the frustration was more broadly over a perceived lack of control over my space. This was my first time not living at home or in a college dorm, and I felt pride in my space. I decorated it and had people over, but I wasn't able to make it feel comfortable for me. The sense of powerlessness was what really triggered such strong emotions, not the thermostat itself.</p>
    <p>During one of our Skype calls, my mom saw me huddled under a pile of blankets and decided to mail me a space heater, my pride be damned. This simple resolution allowed me to regain control of my living space and take ownership of my home. I should have put aside pride and resolve the conflict so that we could all live in harmony. When the solution to fighting is only $50, it's worth it.</p>
