    <p>One blog post I read described regular expressions, or regex, as wildcards on steroids. They are highly applicable in search or find and replace situations. They work by defining a pattern for a string to use when processing text. Regex is a powerful concept and is incorporated in many programming languages, including our very own dear Ruby.</p>
    <p>One of the things that makes regex look confusing is it uses a lot of symbols. Some of them have special meaning - for example, a dollar sign ($) matches at the end of a string, and \b signifies a word boundary. They're scattered throughout the literal characters that we read as normal language, making things look confusing, but if you understand their meaning, you can decipher the code.</p>
    <p>In Ruby, regular expressions are objects, just like strings and classes. They have their own methods and operators.</p>
