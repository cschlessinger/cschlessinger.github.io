    <p>Not to beat a dead horse here, but being a woman in tech can be hard. When I left my PM job at a tech agency before starting DBC, one of the developers on my team decided to make jokes about how the only thing I was cut out to code was kitchen gadgets, which honestly stung — not because I look down on kitchen gadgets (I'm a zealous baker and love me a good kitchen gadget) but because it felt so <em>limiting</em>. Sure, I might eventually want to program kitchen gadgets, but what if I want to work on technology that touches finance? Or databases doing heavy lifting for customer management systems? What if I wanted to do exactly what he was doing and build websites? There were no female developers at my company, so it was hard for my peers to see me acting in their role. I sometimes worry that silly things like my gender presentation or age or hobbies will be heard as louder than my skills. Still, I try not to get down about that and instead focus on things that I know make me a rockstar.</p>
    <h3>Activism</h3>
    <p>My activism is central to this goal. Not only does it benefit me to tear down people's faulty assumptions about my abilities (duh), I feel proud when I am working to make the world a better place. My Twitter feed is full of passionate women technologists breaking glass ceilings and being awesome at their jobs, as well as pursuing a social justice agenda to make coding accessible to all sorts of underrepresented populations. I feel grateful to be benefitting from the work they're doing to make tech a more inclusive space for me and humbled to be walking in their shoes and then joining them in the trenches to participate in the work myself.</p>
    <h3>Personal Development</h3>
    <p>I'm big into personal development. I took the StrengthsFinder test last year and compared the answers to the test when I took it about 8 years before, and only one of the top strengths had remained the same. Responding to circumstances, experiences, and others is a key part of our growth. It would be unimaginable to retain all my same beliefs over time; I have had the joy of traveling and learning and falling in love and experiencing so much of life that have indelibly shaped who I am.</p>
    <h3>Pleasure</h3>
    <p>Confession: I'm not a workaholic. I can't sit in front of my computer for 14 hours a day and grind away at something I don't care about. My motivations are less money or fame as a sense of internal happiness with how I've spent my time. I spent more time than necessary on the JavaScript game challenge because I thoroughly enjoyed what I was doing. And that's how I like my work to be. Beyond the work itself, spending time with my teammates doing enjoyable things is huge. I always bring treats in to work or school because I think self-care is so important. We humans aren't meant to be worked to the bone; we should work because it contributes something positive to the world and to ourselves.</p>
