    <p>I first remember really feeling imposter syndrome when I started undergrad at Brown. I went from being a big fish in a small pond in my Omaha, Nebraska public high school to being a small fish in a big pond at an Ivy League university. I got my first C ever on the first paper I wrote. It was for a sociology class and everybody seemed to have read Marx while I was reading the <i>Magic Tree House</i> series. High school had been about memorization and multiple choice quizzes, and now professors were evaluating my logic and argumentation. I was struggling with even comprehending the materials, let alone responding to them with a substantive thesis.</p>
    <p>I got straight B's that semester. That first paper convinced me that <i>I didn't belong</i> — I wasn't cut out for this level of academic rigor and nothing could change that. I all but gave up.</p>
    <p>Then I changed my perspective. I realized that the International Relations concencentration wasn't my true passion; I wanted to delve into language departments. Then I took intro to anthropology and finally felt like I had something to say. I learned about a little-exercised Brown feature that allows students whose interests lie outside of the bounds of a predefined concentration to create their own, truly owning their education. I wrote a 40-page proposal, consulted with advisors and peers, and poured my heart into that proposal. Unlike most proposals, mine was approved without revisions the first time.</p>
    <p>Over the next two years, particularly while studying abroad, I came into my own. I finally felt like I belonged. Yes, I was still intimidated by the intelligence and achievements of my peers, but I started to isolate admiration for them from how that reflected on myself. I realized that their successes did not mean my failures; we were not in some zero-sum game.</p>

    <p>In the course of my social justice education, I've learned all about imposter syndrome and stereotype threat and how it disproportionately affects women and minorities. From my vantage point of white privilege, I've witnessed other white peers making judgments about black people based on one black employee who made a mistake. For my senior capstone project, I interviewed Spanish- and Creole-speaking immigrants about the pressures they felt to do everything right — only speak English at home, never complain about poor work-life balance, keep quiet about discrimination or racism from customers. The damage incurred by the weight of these burdens is real. Countless studies have proven the existence of implicit bias, even among those who make an active effort to combat it. People who claim that it doesn't exist or that <i>they</i> are not racist/sexist/homophobic/transphobic/ablist are simply burying the truth deeper and taking the approach of willful ignorance, thereby exacerbating the problem.</p>
    <p>When it comes to your own confidence, it's hard to take the approach of doing your own thing, because even if you are sure of yourself, lots of other people might not be. At my last job, as a woman in technology, and particularly as the only one who openly spoke about sexism and feminism, I knew that my actions and abilities were going to be judged within those labels. When I didn't understand a complex technical issue that one of the senior engineers was explaining, I knew that he would likely conclude that I was just another ditz. It's hard to retain confidence in yourself, no matter how much you know the truth, if other people are going to draw their own conclusions — conclusions which may affect how others perceive your promotability, compensation, and overall worth and value.</p>
    <p>Though stereotype threat and the imposter syndrome primarily affect minorities, we are not the ones who can fix the issue. A real solution relies on those in positions of privilege to step outside of their experience and consider the reality of others. It requires a male manager <i>not</i> drawing the conclusion that because the first female developer the company hired struggled, women are by and large bad at coding. It requires investors seeing that great entrepeneurs aren't always young white dudes in hoodies because Mark Zuckerberg. It requires <i>empathy</i> and imagination and vision and these things are hard because of systemic oppression and the forces at work that impede change, but if any industry has a shot at succeeding it's technology, the great disrupter.</p>
