    <h1>Asking Good Questions</h1>
    <h2>Or: How to get people on the Internet to help you</h2>

    <p>The Internet is a mighty tool, but you only get out of it what you put into it. That is, it can only help you to the extent that you tell it what you need help with. We need to ask good questions.</p>
    <p>What makes a good question, you ask? Well, that's a mighty fine question. Let's take troubleshooting, for example. When I worked in customer service, I would get emails from clients that simply said, "I added an article to the website and it isn't working." I would respond with a series of questions that I hoped would elicit the information I needed to provide a satisfactory answer. Which article isn't working? What about it "isn't working"? When did you post it? How is it (not) working now, and how should it work?</p>
    <p>When reporting a bug, it's helpful to include this information:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Where can I view the bug in question? A URL, GitHub page, screenshot, etc.</li>
      <li>What steps did you take to produce this error?</li>
      <li>What is the problem?</li>
      <li>What is the desired outcome?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Knowing these things allows whoever is helping you to see the situation from your eyes, including what the situation is and what it should be. This information is critical. I've asked bad questions before where I left a lot to the reader's guess. People made their inferences based on <i>their</i> perspective. They projected their own histories and biases onto my problem. The problem with my problem was that I didn't lay it out in such a way that people could help me. When asking good questions, seek to communicate specifics so that the problem is clear and people can easily help you.</p>
