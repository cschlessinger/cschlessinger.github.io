    <p>I'm so excited about finally becoming a real San Francisco techie that I've been creeping on the scene from afar. In my stumblings, I found a conference for early-stage startup founders to network and learn. I continued scrolling and got to last year's speakers. Out of 40 in the lineup, there were exactly three women. No people who appeared to be Black or Latinx. The overwhelming majority were young or middle-aged white dudes. I sighed at how perfectly unsurprising this is. For an industry that prides itself on disruption and innovation, it's just as much a manifestation of privilege as the rest of society.</p>
    <p>These observations are hardly new: Being a woman in technology is hard. Sexism is part and parcel of the "culture" that so many start-ups strive for. <a href ="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/05/12/the-end-of-food">Sludge-as-meals</a>, <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/glassdoor-report-the-gender-pay-gap-in-tech-is-still-a-problem/">pay gaps</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/23/business/twitters-ill-timed-frat-party.html">beer pong</a>, and <a href="http://www.laurenbacon.com/women-tech-empathy-work/">emotional labor shunting</a> all reinforce the message that "brogrammers" are the most desired type of programmer and those who prefer to eat their food in solid form or speak up about maternity leave policies won't be a good "cultural fit." White men have long been the most visible faces of success, which inspires more white men to see the possibility of success in themselves (and also creates an illusion of what the face of success looks like for investors).</p>
    <p>Yet I see a vibrant cohort of talented women developers all around me. In my weekly Women Who Code newsletter, I see celebrations of women who have spoken at conferences, landed new jobs, or started new organizations to share their knowledge with young students. I got my start with coding at a RailsBridge workshop for women and continued my learning at workshops with Girl Develop It. On Twitter, I see passionate women enthusiastic about their work. We are real. We exist.</p>
    <p>My job before deciding to do Dev Bootcamp was as a project manager/customer service rep at a digital agency. The tech team was entirely men, who were paid much more than account reps of equal experience levels. Women occupied 100% of the administrative, human resources, and marketing roles and a vast majority of account/customer service. The leadership was dominated by men. Women were also the ones who baked/bought cupcakes for people's birthdays, organized team outings, and even replaced the paper towels when we ran out. And account people were most certainly looked down upon by their developer teammates. While trying to troubleshoot a customer's problem, I frequently got told that it would be a waste to try to explain the issue to me as it would be "too complicated" for me to understand. Developers ignored my questions, instructions, and requests. When I announced that I was leaving the company to learn how to code, there were jokes about how the only thing I was fit to do was program kitchen gadgets to be used by other women. When I pushed for deliverables that were well past deadline, there were vocal complaints about how I reminded them of their nagging mother/wife/girlfriend. There were jokes in team meetings, in front of my boss, about how the best wife is one who can't speak English and does all your cooking and cleaning. People assumed things about me based on my gender, such as an interest in fashion and desire to have children (both nonexistent). The word "bitch" for female clients (and likely co-workers behind our backs) was pervasive and admissible.</p>
    <p>Working at this company exposed me to technology, and over time, I realized that I liked the industry, just not in a client-facing role. I wanted to create. I wanted to be intellectually challenged. I wanted to learn new skills. I have many reasons to be excited about coding in its own right, but I would be lying if I didn't acknowledge that I'm hoping to benefit from being in a role that commands more respect than the traditionally female domain of empathy work. I am not a naturally "nurturing" person. I don't enjoy being a human punching bag for angry clients. I'm happy to shed the responsibility of herding my team to happy hour, figuring out where to go and when to leave and making sure that everybody is accounted for. It's unfortunate that these are responsibilities thrust primarily on women that are either unpaid or underpaid. They are vital, demanding roles and deserve to be accorded respect, same as their coding counterparts. In a way, it feels cowardly of me to run away to the other side rather than trying to fix it.</p>
    <p>Still, taking on a different role won't shield me from all of the unpleasantness of being a woman in tech. I know that I will stand out. I know that men on my team will doubt my skills, view me as an intruder, and feel their culture threatened by my presence. I know that sexism will continue to happen around and to me, in ways both small and large. I know that as a white women, the challenges I face are minimal compared to women of color. But it's okay, I can handle it; we women are tougher than we get credit for.</p>
