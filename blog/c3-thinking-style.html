    <h2>Or: A rant about personality quizzes</h2>

    <p>I have to get this off my chest: I hate personality quizzes. On the surface, they seem like something I should like: categorizing, listing, ordering, and narcissm (we'll come back to this in a sec). They (theoretically) help people understand different perspectives and personalities and needs and strenghts and weakness, which is all great and handy and peachy yay.</p>
    <p><strong>But.</strong></p>
    <p>Gregorc's Mind Styles quiz professes to "provide an organized way to consider how the mind works" using four different styles. I mean, let's stop right there for a second. Four different paradigms of thinking for the entire population? That right there seems pretty crazy. I mean, aren't we all complex, special snowflake individuals with peculiarities and contradictions and all? How is a quiz of 16 questions going to distill my essence?</p>
    <p> It's true that I <i>am</i> someone who likes order and reality. That's what the quiz told me. But that only won out by one question to being someone who likes theory and abstract thought. Wait, aren't those contradictory? How can I be <i>both</i>?</p>
    <p>And therein lies the rub: We people <i>are</i> really complex! Some people prefer abstract thought for certain problems and experimentation with certain tasks and order with certain constraints and reflectoin for certain experiences! I cannot be just one thing. The world throws us too many curveballs to be able to say definitively that <i>this</i> is how I will approach any given problem.</p>
    <p>My apartment is in total disarray as I pack up my life to move to San Francisco. I did my bedroom first so that I would have one sanctuary to retreat to when the rest of the chaos overwhelms me, which it often does. I like my life to be ordered, sequential, and linear, when possible. But when I'm learning, I need to hold things in my hands and walk through the steps. I need to experiment to absorb what it is. In my personal life, I have to learn through reflection. I rely on my experiences with others and their life stories in order to gain wisdom. And some of life's problems are too big or draining or demanding to consider in any of these ways and must be dealt with abstractly. Where does humankind's capacity for violence and hatred come from? When confronted with the pain we inflict on one another so callously and regularly, I cannot consider the brutal reality and must worridly think in broad strokes and clouds of ideas.</p>
    <p>This challenge asks us to consider our learning styles and default mindsets and how our assessments impact our learning. I am glad to say that my smorgasbord of personalities and styles and mindsets provides me with a well-stocked toolbox for handling the challenges that DBC will throw at me. I would be disappointed with myself if I fit in one box, if one answer only spoke to me and all other perspectives were incomprehensible.</p>
