      To be honest, I kind of found the whole Engineering Empathy schtick a little cheesy. I mean, we're all adults here, right? We're coming here to learn how to code, not to hold hands and sing kumbaya.

      Five days into Phase 0, though, I'm kind of digging it. All the talk about collaboration and empathy and we're really walking the walk. A large part of Phase 0 happens on Google+. But on the first day, you could hear crickets. I told myself that people were just <i>ermahgerd</i> to FINALLY be starting that they were heads down in the week 1 curriculum. I decided to pace myself and look up around me. So I put up a few posts. I asked if anyone else in Chicago wanted to meet up to do pairing in person or just have a study buddy IRL. Someone responded — with enthusiasm. Then another someone responded — equally enthusiastic. I asked a question. It got 15 responses. Someone who read my posts friended me on Facebook, and we've been texting, messaging, and Snapchatting each other moral support as we get used to this thing.

      Five days in and the Google+ community is a full on Athenian agora of resources, questions, answers, and general support. We are in the back of the house, ferociously chopping and stirring and plating and sometimes burning and starting over but we're all doing it together. I can't wait to see what we cook up.
