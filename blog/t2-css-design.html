    <h2>A breakdown of CSS positioning property values</h2>

      An essential property in your CSS toolkit is the one that positions elements, kindly named the "position" property. It's also one of the trickier ones to understand, so let's break it down.
    </p>
    <h4>Static</h4>
      <p>This is how your elements get positioned by default if you don't specify a different value (therefore this is the same as if you specify "initial"). This is how things would flow into place in order based on the DOM. This is how these for divs come together with their positions all set to static:</p> 
      <img src="static-1.png" width="82%"/>
      <p>Note that Div 1 has a margin-bottom set, so Div 2 just scootches in at the next available position
    <h4>Fixed</h4>
      <p>Fixed positioning is used for placing elements relative to the browser window. It's good for things like a fixed navigation bar or a sidebar or footer â€” basically anything that you want to stay around the periphery. This is how all of these divs appear when in a fixed position and no top or left value determining how far away from the browser edge they should be. See how they all overlap with each other starting in the top left corner? Without margins or padding to specify where they should fall in relation to the window, they all go to the same place.</p>
      <img src="fixed-1.png" width="82%"/>
    <h4>Relative</h4>
      <p>Relative positioning is used for arranging pieces around each other. This interacts closely with the "display" property, which determines whether an element will take up the whole line, share a line, or retain its size. 
    <h4>Absolute</h4>
