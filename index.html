					<h2>&mdash;&mdash; Why Me &mdash;&mdash;</h2>
					<h3>How my experiences, strengths, and philosophy translate into being your best hire ever</h3>
					<h4>Perspective</h4>
					<p>My first two years in the technology industry were spent in a project management role. Having managed the development process, I have the skills to self-direct with sensitivity toward budget and timeline considerations and the project's big picture. My extended perspective on the holistic process of shipping a product make me so much more than simply a code monkey.</p>
					<h4>Mover and Shaker</h4>
					<p>As an undergraduate at Brown University, I established my own major, Language & Culture Studies, to tailor my curriculum and maximize its value. When working a project manager in Chicago inspired a career transition to coding, I dropped everything to move to the heart of the tech scene and study at Dev Bootcamp, equipping myself with new skills and direction. I have a track record of taking action to achieve my goals, never being stoppped by fears or challenges.</p>
					<h4>Agility</h4>
					<p>As a polyglot, I understand how to derive patterns to facilitate learning. I started my studies with French, so by the time I added Spanish, I skipped two levels because I didn't need to start with verb moods and the types of articles. After Latin, declensions in Russian were a breeze, and Polish is awfully similar to Russian if you know what pronunciation tweaks to make. This dexterity allows me to pick up new technologies with ease.</p>
					<h4>Attitude</h4>
					<p>I am the lighthearted cheer during an all-nighter, the voice of optimism in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges, the sharer of homemade cookies on a Monday. Seriously, I bake lots of cookies and like to share.</p>
					<h4>Information Hoarder</h4>
					<p>I am a collector of information. When I have a meeting, I show up with all my ducks in a row and every material read and annotated so that we can get right down to business.</p>
					<h4>Communication</h4>
					<p>Words are my trade. I strive for the trifecta of clarity, concision, and kindness. I am an active listener and believe that empathetic communication can solve the majority of conflict that teams face.</p>

					<h2>&mdash;&mdash; About Me &mdash;&mdash;</h2>
					<h3>Beyond being a rockstar dev, I'm also a human who likes things like pancakes and pugs!</h3>
					<img src="images/headshot.jpg"/>
					<p>Originally from Nebraska, I made my way to San Francisco by way of Providence and Chicago, with some stints in France and Russia along the way. Some fun facts: my patronus is a pug, my fatal flaw is hoarding too many browser tabs, my favorite book is <i>The Little Prince</i> (in the original French, <i>bien sûr</i>), and my go-to accessory is a weird hat. I make some really amazing lemon-filled brownies (you're skeptical now but wait until I bring some to work to share). In my free time, I can be found surfing the Web's vegetarian blogs and feminist sites, frolicking at farmers' markets, or blowing off steam at yoga.</p>

					<h2>&mdash;&mdash; Recommendations &mdash;&mdash;</h2>
					<h3>But what do people who've actually worked with me think?</h3>
					<p>"Claire is terrific at planning and executing projects with the customer as the central focus. She is smart, committed, organized and straightforward. I enjoyed working with her on our particular project and would recommend her to others."</p>
					<h4>Tanya, Director of Development at CARPLS Legal Aid</h4>
					<p>"As Claire's manager, I recognize her status as an integral member of the account team at One North. Her organization and attention to detail can’t be matched. Working with 20+ clients, this skill can’t be more critical. She is a team player and truly cares about her team. She takes initiative, consistently adding new skills to her repertoire. She has gained client trust and builds strong relationships. She also participates in the community and puts herself into everything she does with enthusiasm. Claire is smart and efficient in the workplace."</p>
