				<h2>&mdash;&mdash; Why Me &mdash;&mdash;</h2>
				<h3>How my experiences, strenghts, and philosophy translate into being your best hire ever</h3>
				<h4>Organization</h4>
				<p>My first two years in the technology industry were spent in a project management role. I know the right questions to ask, the risks to heed, challenges to consider, and pitfalls to preempt. Moreover, having managed a tech team, I have the skills to manage myself. I am hyper aware of budget and timeline restrictions and take seriously the factors driving a project beyond the technical role I play.</p>
				<h4>Intellection</h4>
				<p>My brain is always going. I am driven by a relentless curiosity to leave no stone unturned in pursuing knowledge. I seek the next, the best, the latest. An agile methodology comes pre-programmed. I surround myself with smart people and revel in the particular joy of synergy of knowledge. I never shy away from the tricky conversations or the hard problems because finding the answers and untangling the clutter makes my eyes light up.</p>
				<h4>Attitude</h4>
				<p>I am the lighthearted cheer during an all-nighter, the voice of optimism in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges, the presenter of homemade cookies on a Monday. Seriously, I bake lots of cookies.</p>
				<h4>Input</h4>
				<p>am a collector of information. Browser tabs full of StackOverflow topics and new recipes and articles from Twitter and inspiring websites to pin, my emails neatly sorted into folders and subfolders with nary a message out of place, sticky notes with new tricks and questions and reminders. When I have a meeting, I show up with all my ducks in a row and every material read and annotated so that we can get right down to business.</p>
				<h4>Adaptability</h4>
				<p>Ready to change course at a moment’s notice, if called for. Information gets inputted, triaged, and handled.</p>
				<h4>Compassion</h4>
				<p>As a social justice warrior in my free time, I endeavor to infuse all my dealings with understanding and humanity. With my timeless idealism, I’m truly here to make the world a better place.</p>
				<h4>Connectedness</h4>
				<h4>Perspective</h4>
				<h4>Communication</h4>
				<p>Words are my trade. I strive for the trifecta of clarity, concision, and kindness in my interactions with others. I am an active listener and believe that compassionate communication can solve the majority of conflict that teams face.</p>

				<h2>&mdash;&mdash; About Me &mdash;&mdash;</h2>
				<h3>Beyond being a rockstar dev, I'm also a human who likes things like pancakes and pugs!</h3>
				<img src="headshot.jpg"/>
				<p>Originally from Nebraska, I've lived in four states and four countries. I speak, to varying fluencies, French, Russian, Spanish, Polish, and Latin. My spirit animal is a pug. My go-to news source is the New York Times, go-to pick-me-up is Humans of New York, and go-to accessory is a weird hat. I make really amazing lemon-filled brownies (I know it sounds weird but just go with it). Farmers' markets make me giddy, and I believe that true perfection lies in the optimally ripe avocado. When not working, I can be found surfing the Web's vegetarian blogs and feminist sites, making a mess in the kitchen, or listening to tearful singer-songwriters. Fun fact: My favorite book is The Little Prince (in the original French, <i>bien sûr</i>.</p>

				<h3>But what do people who've actually worked with me think?</h3>
				<p>"Claire is terrific at planning and executing projects with the customer as the central focus. She is smart, committed, organized and straightforward. I enjoyed working with her on our particular project and would recommend her to others."</p>
				<h4>Tanya P, Director of Development at CARPLS Legal Aid</h4>
				<p>"As Claire's manager, I recognize her status as an integral member of the account team at One North. Her organization and attention to detail can’t be matched. Working with 20+ clients, this skill can’t be more critical. She is a team player and truly cares about her team. She takes initiative, consistently adding new skills to her repertoire. She has gained client trust and builds strong relationships. She also participates in the community and puts herself into everything she does with enthusiasm. Claire is smart and efficient in the workplace."</p>
